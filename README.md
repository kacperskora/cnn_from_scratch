# Convolutional Neural Network from scratch

**Motivation**
The purpose of this project was to create a convolutional neural network from scratch for image classification on MNIST dataset but also to get the idea of how it works from initializing parameters to evaluating the model. It was made  to also understand the math idea underlying these processes. 

**Project structure:**
- main.py: main file. Set hyperparameters, load dataset, build, train and evaluate the model.
- model.py: network class file. Implement the convolutional neural network.
- layer.py: layer class file. Implement each layer of cnovolutional neural network.
- inout.py: import dataset and preprocess it
- plots.py: plot diagnostics plots of misjudged examples or weights and biases values
